## This respository contains the exercises and solutions from Google's Python course found here https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/basic

To run the files contained in this repository, type `python <filename>.py`. This will run the tests that are written in the file. This is the same Test Driven Development approach as Exercism. When you have written all the necessary code, the tests will pass. There are solutions in the `solutions/` directory.
